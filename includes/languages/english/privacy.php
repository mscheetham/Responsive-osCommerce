define('TEXT_INFORMATION', 'We know that you care how information about you is used and shared,
 and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy.
 By visiting our site, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.<br /><br />
<B>What Personal Information About Customers Does Our Site Gather?</B><br />
The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your shopping experience at
 our site. Here are the types of information we gather.<br /><br />
<B>Information You Give Us:</B><br />
We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way.
 You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our
 features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future
 shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you.<br /><br />
<B>Automatic Information:</B><br />
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites,
 we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses our site.
 Scroll to the bottom of this page to see examples of the information we receive. A number of companies
 offer utilities designed to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide you with a
 personalized experience at our site if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist.<br /><br />
<B>E-mail Communications:</B><br />
To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from
 our site if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received from
 other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive
 e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your account to reflect this by selecting unsubscribed in the newsletters menu.<br /><br />
<B>Information from Other Sources:</B><br />
For reasons such as improving personalization of our service (for example, providing better product recommendations
 or special offers that we think will interest you), we might receive information about you from other sources and add it
 to our account information. We also sometimes receive updated delivery and address information from our shippers or other
 sources so that we can correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily.<br /><br />
<B>What About Cookies?</B><br />
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computers hard drive through your Web browser to enable
 our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as automatic login and permanent shopping carts for
 storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits.<br />
The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies,
 how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
 However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of our site\'s coolest features, and we recommend that
 you leave them turned on.<br /><br />
<B>Does Our Site Share the Information It Receives?</B><br />
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to
 others. We share customer information only with the subsidiaries our site controls and as described below.<br /><br />
<B>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:</B><br />
We do not share any information about you with any other business only companies affiliated with our site.
<br /><br />
<B>Agents And Business Partners:</B><br />
We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.
 Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information
 from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing
 customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for
 other purposes.<br /><br />
<B>Promotional Offers:</B><br />
Sometimes we send offers by fax or email to selected groups of our site\'s customers on behalf of other businesses.
 When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers,
 please adjust your account newsletter preference as that is how we will send out our promotions.<br /><br />
